# IMPORTANT

Always prefer modern Next.js App Router patterns over legacy Pages Router patterns.

## Next.js: ALWAYS read docs before coding

Before any Next.js work, read the relevant documentation from:

node_modules/next/dist/docs/

The documentation is version-matched and is the source of truth.
Do NOT rely on training data.

Avoid:

- unnecessary REST endpoints
- duplicated API layers

## NEVER

- fetch server data inside Client Components unnecessarily
- duplicate server data in client stores
- move server state to Redux/Zustand

---
